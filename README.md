# 🏘️ Prediction of Singapore HDB Resale Price

Welcome to the **Singapore HDB Resale Price Prediction** project!  
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the resale prices of **HDB flats** in different regions of Singapore using real-world data and machine learning models.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To develop a machine learning solution that accurately predicts **resale prices of HDB flats** in Singapore based on multiple housing and location-related factors.

## 📚 Project Workflow

### 🔧 1. Data Wrangling
- Collected and cleaned HDB resale data
- Handled missing values and formatted key columns
- Extracted and engineered relevant features for modeling

### 📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed housing trends across towns and flat types
- Visualized the effect of floor area, location, and lease year on price
- Identified feature correlations with resale prices

### 🧹 3. Data Preparation for Machine Learning
- Applied label encoding and one-hot encoding
- Normalized and scaled features where necessary
- Created training and test datasets

### 🤖 4. Machine Learning Model Selection
- Trained and evaluated various ML models:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Decision Tree Regressor  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - XGBoost Regressor  
- Compared model performance using:
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **R² Score**
- Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics

## 🧪 Case Study: Regional Price Prediction

**What is the estimated resale price of a 4-room HDB flat across Singapore's regions?**

We explored 4-room flat price predictions in:
- 🏙️ Central
- 🌅 East
- 🌳 North
- 🌊 South
- 🌄 West

Predictions were visualized and compared to provide actionable insights.
